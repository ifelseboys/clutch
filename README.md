# Newton 

# بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

# what does it provide ?

- Newton is your secretary, that helps you control you computer as you wish.
you are the batman, it is the robbin.

- You have the power of deciding what happens when on your device.
- It Exists to help you gather every thing in one place instead of dozens of tools 


- Newton is based on the idea of **Triggers** and **Reactions**
## Triggers : 

- At startup (MachineStartTrigger)
- TimeTriggers (repeating and non-repeating)
- resources consumption (memory, cpu, disk, battery...etc.)
- prayer times (coming soon  ان شاء الله )

## Reactions:

- push notifications
- Open files
- Close files
- execute commands 
- adjust brightness
- shutdown your device

```a relation between a trigger(or more) and a reaction(or more) is called a Rule```

> if you are a developer, and you have some experience with java,
OOP and design patterns, please help us have a better Newton!
It was made with care specifically to be **easy to expand**.

As long as you write *safe and tested code*, you more than welcomed

**Please, before doing anything**, check the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file 



## how is that useful : 
- I want a notification every 15 minutes to remind me to stretch my back
- or If you want to close epic games if your CPU usage is bigger than 90 % 
- You want to execute a command every time you open you device 
- You might want to reduce brightness at night to sleep well

it's flexible so you can do whatever you want with it
