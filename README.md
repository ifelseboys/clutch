# Newton project

**بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم**

Newton is your secretary, that helps you control you computer as you wish.
you are the batman, he is the robbin.
he can send notifications, excute commands, open files, kill processes
whenever you want and under you constraints.
he can monitor resources to protect you from applications lurking in the background
hungry for you own memory and CPU.

if you are a developer, and you have some experience with java,
OOP and design patterns, please help us have a better Newton!
It was made with care specifically to be **easy to expand**.

As long as you write *safe and tested code*, you more than welcomed
to add to the project.

You might need to check out the [TODO](./TODO.md) file to be able to help us improve this project.
