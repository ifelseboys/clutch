# what is Clutch
Clutch is the tool that helps you control your device, deciding what happens when and why.

He is the robbin you are the batman.

Clutch was made to achieve harmony between all the tasks and events that happen on you device.
just like the clutch in a car.
it was made to collect dozens of tools in 1 place, instead of many tools!


Clutch is based on the idea of **Triggers** and **Reactions**

when all of the triggers happen, reactions are performed to your device.
## Triggers :

- At startup (MachineStartTrigger)
- TimeTriggers (repeating and non-repeating)
- resources consumption (memory, cpu, disk, battery...etc.)
- a window containing some word

## Reactions:

- a notification with a verse from the Holy Qur'an
- push a notification
- Open a file
- Close a file
- execute a command
- adjust brightness
- shutdown your device

```a relation between a trigger(or more) and a reaction(or more) is called a Rule```

## how is Clutch useful?
- I want a notification every 15 minutes to remind me to stretch my back
- or If you want to close a game if your CPU usage is bigger than 90 %
- You want to execute a command every time you open your device
- You might want to reduce brightness at night to sleep well

it's flexible so you can do whatever you want with it

---


```please note that triggers are tied together with a logical AND```


go ahead and create you own Rules!
